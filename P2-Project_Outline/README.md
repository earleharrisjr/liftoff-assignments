## Submission Instructions

### Overview

The ticket system will provide the help desk agent with tools to log and keep track of issues until they are solved by techs. Users will create accounts. The user will generate a ticket that goes into a pool for all tickets and provide the date/ time, heading/ issue, and a note with contact information for whoever generated the ticket. Users (as well as their team) will be able to log in and view a list of tickets that are open. When clicking to "view" a ticket, the user/ team will be able to see all relative information as well as add notes so anyone else working on the issue can see what work has been down and who is doing it. Once solved, the user/team can mark the issue as solved and the ticket goes into a seperate container as solved with notes regarding how it was solved as well has who solved it.
